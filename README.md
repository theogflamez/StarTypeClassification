# StarTypeClassification

Machine Learning Model used off of Random Forest Classifier to correctly predict stars based off their
- Absolute Temperature (in K)
- Relative Luminosity (L/Lo)
- Relative Radius (R/Ro)
- Absolute Magnitude (Mv)
- Star Color (white,Red,Blue,Yellow,yellow-orange etc)
- Spectral Class (O,B,A,F,G,K,,M)
- Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)**

  Model performed with perfect accuracy and 1.0 r^2 value.
